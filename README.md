**_<h2>Purpose</h2>_**

In the Australian amateur boxing scene, it can be difficult to match your boxers with fighters of the appropriate weight class and experience. Often, fighters are matched through simple word of mouth. FightClub is designed to provide an easy solution where Coaches may view a repository of Fighter profiles and find appropriate matches for their boxers that can then be scheduled.

FightClub's purpose is to fill a needed gap in the market for a website that can act as a "phonebook" of Boxers and allow for easy scheduling of amateur bouts between Boxers from different Gyms.

**_<h2>Functionality / features</h2>_**

The core functionality of the website is in two parts:

1. The creation and storage of fighter profiles that anybody in the public can view.
2. The scheduling of boxing matches between these fighters.

We also intend on implementing certain functionality, if given the opportunity, that are not required for the minimum viable product. They are:

1. Private messaging. Although this would certainly be handy to allow for communication on the website itself, it is not absolutely necessary as long as the coaches can still view the repository of Boxer profiles and approach their relevant coaches about scheduling a fight off-line.

2. Tracking of Boxer Statistics. There already exists other resources to track a fighter's win/loss record, and although this would be nice to have - it is not completely necessary.

3. Match history to be viewable on Fighter Profiles (as well as, of course, win-loss records).

**_<h2>Target Audience</h2>_**

The target audience are:

1. The local boxers who want to view the profiles of their fellow competitors.
2. Coaches who are seeking to match their competitors with other fighters of the appropriate weight-class and experience.
3. Fans of the sport / friends and relations of the fighters who want to keep up-to-date on boxing events.

**_<h2>Tech-stack</h2>_**

## Front End:

### **ReactJS**

Our front end Javascript library of choice. React is used to build out our user interface and components due being an extremely versatile while still being free and open-source.

### **CSS**

CSS is used for the styling of the website. This was chosen over a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Tailwind as it allows for greater control over the styling of the website. It is also the preferred method for both developers of this site.

## Back End

### **Ruby on Rails**

Rails is working as our server-side application framework. A Model-View-Controller based system that integrates with React and PostgreSQL extremely well, all while being an easy to read and work with framework.

### **PostgreSQL**

An SQL database that is open-sourced and object-relational, making it perfect for this website. Its integration with Rails is simple, yet is advanced enough that It can be scaled along side the website.
